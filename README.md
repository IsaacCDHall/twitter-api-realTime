# Twitter Twitter Little Star

I built a real time application using react, express, and socket IO to display tweets.

I have updated the infrastructure and deployed to [heroku](https://stark-shelf-47805.herokuapp.com/), these updates can be found at my repo called [socket-io-express](https://github.com/IsaacCDHall/socket-io-express). These changes are in new repo because I didn't want to erase the work I had completed in this one in the process. This repo still works locally but the structure changed to better suit heroku deployment
